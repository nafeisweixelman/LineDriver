# LineDriver
Autonomous line following robot using a Raspberry Pi and Python

We used the following with this project
1) Four DC motors and wheels
2) Raspberry Pi 4
3) Raspberry Pi Camera
4) L298N Motor Controllers

1) In order to run this code, you need to install OpenCV and the required support software for it.
2) You can follow this tutorial, I recommend installing the full package and not the pip version.

3) For our code, we had to enter the Python Virtual Environment by using the "workon cv" command at terminal.
4) In order to use the GPIOZero class, you will have to install that directly into the Virtual Environment.
5) Then to run the code, browse to the file directory to the right folder and run the python scripts.
