# LineDriver
Autonomous line following robot using a Raspberry Pi and Python

We used the following with this project:
-Four DC motors and wheels
-Raspberry Pi 4
-Raspberry Pi Camera
-L298N Motor Controllers

The following steps are needed for implimentation:
-In order to run this code, you need to install OpenCV and the required support software for it.
-You can follow this tutorial, I recommend installing the full package and not the pip version.

-For our code, we had to enter the Python Virtual Environment by using the "workon cv" command at terminal.
-In order to use the GPIOZero class, you will have to install that directly into the Virtual Environment.
-Then to run the code, browse to the file directory to the right folder and run the python scripts.
